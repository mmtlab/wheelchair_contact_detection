# Wheelchair handrim contact detection
This project aims to the development of a vision system that can detect whether or not the hand is in contact with the handrim during wheelchair propulsion in an environment where other measuring systems are available, such as wheelchair ergometer and instrumented wheel.

It's a further implementation of the work "HPPD" in which the hand position wrt handrim was expressed using mediapipe and contact was assessed by means of torque signal collected by the ergometer.

The current challenge is to switch the ground truth with a signal coming from a capacitive sleeve placed around the handrim, more reliable and more accurate than the previous solution.
